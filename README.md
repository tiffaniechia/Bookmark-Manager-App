##Bookmark Manager

The goal of this task is to learn about Sinatra, Relational Databases, and Security via a Bookmark Manager  where users can keep a list of their favourite sites.
This Bookmark Manager will be similar to pineapple.io or delicious.com in spirit.

This app allows a user to add a favourite link with tags. Each post belongs to a user and is stamped as such. Each tag has many posts and therefore posts can be searched via tags.

A rudimentary security feature has been added via BCrypt as well.
