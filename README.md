## Week 4 project: Bookmark Manager

From Hackpad: 
"This week's project is a bookmark manager. The goal is to expose you to the following aspects of web development, in addition to what we've studied before:

Integration testing: Capybara (Monday)
Relational databases (Tuesday and Wednesday)
Security considerations (Thursday)

In addition to the technologies mentioned above, this project is going to be more challenging on the front-end. You shouldn't need more than we've covered in the previous weeks but you should expect to spend more time on the front-end, compared to Sudoku â€“ web version. Of course, we'll also continue to be using the technologies we're familiar with: Sinatra, RSpec, etc."
